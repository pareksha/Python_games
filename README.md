# Python_games
This repo contains simple games in python. These games are for beginners in Python. I coded these myself when I had started learning python. This repo is useful for anyone who is interested in building good coding skills and want to emerge as a good Python developer. No one can start with large projects until they do such small projects. 

# Hangman
Hangman is a primitive word hunt game. My version is built as a simple terminal game.

# Guessing Game
This is the easiest game for any coder. It illustrates the usefulness of the random module for any coder.

# Tic-Tac-Toe
A zero-cross game built on the terminal. You play against the computer. It took me 8 hours to build the algorithm (as a beginner). Even if you don't wanna build it, go play and have fun. Let's see if you can win this one!
