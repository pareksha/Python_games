# Python_games
This repo contains simple games in python. These games are for beginners in Python. I coded these myself when I had started learning python. This repo is useful for anyone who is interested in building good coding skills and want to emerge as a good Python developer. No one can start with large projects until they do such small projects. 

# Hangman
Hangman is a primitive word hunt game. My version is built as a simple terminal game.

# Guessing Game
This is the easiest game for any coder. It illustrates the usefulness of the random module for any coder.

# Tic-Tac-Toe
A zero-cross game built on the terminal. You play against the computer. It took me 8 hours to build the algorithm (as a beginner). Even if you don't wanna build it, go play and have fun. Let's see if you can win this one!

# Mouse Hunter
Mouse hunter is a board game in which a computer hides a mouse in a grid of your choice. You have to find the mouse within a limited number of guesses. But this isn't the real fun!  
The real thing that may surprise you is that you can hide the mouse and the computer will be happy to find it for you. And you know what the computer can be much more intelligent than you if you program it so!
